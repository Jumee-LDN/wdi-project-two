# hungry korilla

## WDI-PROJECT-TWO

This was the second project assignment during my time on General Assembly's Web Development Immersive Course (week 5-6). 'hungry korilla' is a Korean restaurant review site. The app allows users to:
* Search Korean restaurants filtered by city.
* Sign up.
* Only logged in user can :
* Post their favourite restaurant.
* Edit and delete their review.


##### [Visit the website](https://hungrykorilla.herokuapp.com/) to check it out (the app is not yet fully responsive. For best experience open on laptop).

## Brief

Three options:
* Instagram
* Medium
* Restaurant Review

Design a full-stack Node app that must include:
* At least two models.
* At least one embedded or referenced schema.
* A persistent database (with all CRUD actions on records).
* User authentification (registration and session creation).
* RESTful routes.
* EJS for template creation.
* A CSS framework on the front-end.
* Deployed on Heroku.

## Build Process


### Plan
From the experience of [my first project](https://github.com/Jumee-LDN/wdi-project-one) I knew it was crucial to get to MVP as soon as possible. With that in mind, I:
* Created a list of all the features I wanted to create.
* Created a site structure.

### Build



### MVP


### Refactor

### Bugs


### Challenges
* **Populating Embedded Schema** - In
* **Silly Mistakes** -
 1.
 2.

* **Time & Stress & Productivity Management** -


## Moving Forward / Future Features
Some features I could add moving forward:
* Clean up restrictions around user functionality when logged in vs when not logged in.


## Lessons Learned
* **Plan is just a plan.**


## Other GA projects
